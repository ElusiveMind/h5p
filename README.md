H5P
====

Upload interactive HTML5 Packages to your Backdrop site.

With this module you will be able to create interactive videos, question sets,
drag and drop questions, multichoice questions, boardgames, presentations,
flashcards and more using Backdrop.

All the content is HTML5, meaning it will work great on smartphones, tablets and
other mobile devices. With H5P, you create and edit HTML5 content directly in
your web browser just like you edit any other Backdrop content.

In addition to being an authoring tool for rich content, H5P also enables your
site to import and export H5P files. H5P files are package files for HTML5
content and applications. They work much the same way as Flash files work. You
can easily upload them to your Backdrop site and publish rich Internet content and
applications. Whenever you upload a new type of content as an H5P file, your
editor will learn how to create and edit this type of content so that you're
able to create more content of the same type, using the H5P editor. This makes
H5P a very powerful authoring tool.

Installation and usage
------------

1. Copy H5P directory to your modules directory
2. Enable the module at the module administration page
